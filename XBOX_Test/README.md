Simulink Code to allow for basic xbox controller to control servo's on the BotBoarduino

Code will send signals from a computer with an xbox controller to the arduino which will then send back the values to confirm that data is being sent and recived
Arduino and Xbox controller need to be plugged into the same computer

Lookup tables generated to map controller to 0-180 values sent over serial

NB: when sending to hardware, use Arduino PRO and set the COM port correctly

MATLAB/Simulink R2019b Required along with Arduino Support Package which can be found through the adons


Simulink AddOn required for Xbox control also included along with examples found at the link below
